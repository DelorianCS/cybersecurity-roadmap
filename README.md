# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Roadmap

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity roadmap repository.

I’m Delorian, the creator of the original roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/r/cibersecurity-roadmap), and this repo contains my full expanded journey from zero knowledge to becoming a cybersecurity professional — both defensive (Blue Team) and offensive (Red Team).
